# fates-tree-grass
some scripts for exploring model simulation: seasonal cycle of outputs and site-model comparison for state-wide simulation.
Note that, running the .Rmd file, however, requires other dependencies from https://github.com/mpaiao/FATES_Utils, the file itself also is adapted from Marcos's original script.
The change I made is to analyze state-wide simulation instead of single point simulation. Also, soil water varibales are added for site-model comparison.
